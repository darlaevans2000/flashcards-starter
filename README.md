## Introduction
This is a basic flashcards application which can be played in 
the command line interface. 
Users can select between multiple choices and will receive feedback about whether their answer was correct or incorrect.
The percentage of questions they answered correctly will be displayed at the end once they have answered all questions, 
along with the total time it took for the user to go through all of the flashcards.

## Demonstration
Flashcards can be played in the terminal and will give feedback on if user answers are correct or incorrect.
